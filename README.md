# Network Analysis in Python

This is a simple Python script for network analysis using the NetworkX library.

## Installation

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Install NetworkX**: Install the NetworkX library using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install networkx
    ```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-analysis-python.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Use the `cd` command to enter the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd network-analysis-python
    ```

3. **Run the Script**: Execute the Python script `network_analysis.py` using the following command:
    ```bash
    python network_analysis.py
    ```

## What It Does

- **Graph Creation**: The script creates a simple network graph with nodes and edges.
- **Visualization**: It visualizes the graph using NetworkX and Matplotlib.
- **Network Metrics**: It calculates and prints various network metrics, including the number of nodes, number of edges, average clustering coefficient, and average shortest path length.

## Acknowledgements

This script utilizes the [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) library for network analysis and visualization.
